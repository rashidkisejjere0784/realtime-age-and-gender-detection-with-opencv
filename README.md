# realtime-age-and-gender-detection-with-opencv
Trained a model that is able to detect the age and gender in realtime using open cv and haar cascades model

The link to the dataset is - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanmukh05/agedetection

The dataset has very few black people image so it's a bit biased

Due to RAM constraints i had to limit the training process to only 110 images per age.

I trained the model using a Kaggle notebook - https://www.kaggle.com/code/rashidrk/age-and-gender-detection

The code uses haar cascades model to extract the faces in the image
